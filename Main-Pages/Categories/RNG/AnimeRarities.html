        Sol’s RNG is a Roblox experience where your main goal is to get as many different and rare auras as possible. To help you in this quest, you may be curious as to whether there are any new Sol’s RNG codes for you to snap up – and we’re here to answer that.

                How do I get Sol’s RNG codes?

                    As we mentioned above, the game’s description suggests that codes are mostly server based, so we think it’s likely that you’ll be able to find them through server messages in the future. You can also join the Sol’s Studio Roblox group  and Discord for future update announcements, and there’s a Sol’s RNG wiki where you can learn all about the game’s items, auras, effects, and more.
